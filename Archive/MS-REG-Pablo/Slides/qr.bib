 abstract = {An algorithm for computing parametric linear quantile regression estimates subject to linear inequality constraints is described. The algorithm is a variant of the interior point algorithm described in Koenker and Portnoy (1997) for unconstrained quantile regression and is consequently quite efficient even for large problems, particularly when the inherent sparsity of the resulting linear algebra is exploited. Applications to qualitatively constrained nonparametric regression are described in the penultimate sections. Implementations of the algorithm are available in MATLAB and R.},

  abstract={Structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models are important tools for empirical work in macroeconomics, finance, and related fields. This book not only reviews the many alternative structural VAR approaches discussed in the literature, but also highlights their pros and cons in practice. It provides guidance to empirical researchers as to the most appropriate modeling choices, methods of estimating, and evaluating structural VAR models. The book traces the evolution of the structural VAR methodology and contrasts it with other common methodologies, including dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. It is intended as a bridge between the often quite technical econometric literature on structural VAR modeling and the needs of empirical researchers. The focus is not on providing the most rigorous theoretical arguments, but on enhancing the reader's understanding of the methods in question and their assumptions. Empirical examples are provided for illustration.},

 abstract = {A simple minimization problem yielding the ordinary sample quantiles in the location model is shown to generalize naturally to the linear model generating a new class of statistics we term "regression quantiles." The estimator which minimizes the sum of absolute residuals is an important special case. Some equivariance properties and the joint asymptotic distribution of regression quantiles are established. These results permit a natural generalization of the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location. Estimators are suggested, which have comparable efficiency to least squares for Gaussian linear models while substantially out-performing the least-squares estimator over a wide class of non-Gaussian error distributions.},

The tests offer a simple way to evaluate the correct specification of predictive densities, where both the model specification and its estimation technique are evaluated jointly. Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that our tests are well sized and have good power in detecting misspecification. An empirical application to density forecasts of the Survey of Professional Forecasters shows the usefulness of our methodology."
